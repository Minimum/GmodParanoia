# Paranoia
Paranoia is a gamemode for Garry's Mod that is based off of The Thing.  Players begin each game as either a human or an alien.  The goal of the humans is to locate and eliminate the aliens.  The goal of the aliens is to infect or kill all humans.  Aliens are able to assume their true alien form or a human form.  This results in extreme paranoia among the players, hence the name.

# Purpose
This gamemode was originally created in 2013 for GS Lans.  It was never progressed past the beta stage.  At the time it ran well enough to play, with some minor known issues.  Between that and the constant refactoring of the Garry's Mod framework, this gamemode will likely encounter game breaking errors today.  The purpose of releasing the code to this project is purely for educational reasons.  Feel free to look through the code to learn or even use the code for your own projects.

This project will likely never be updated again.  Garry's Mod and the Source Engine is just too outdated to justify developing for.  Instead, I am looking into Unreal Engine 4 for my future gamedev endeavors.
